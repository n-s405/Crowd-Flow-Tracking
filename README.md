## Description 
    PUT SOMETHING HERE 

## Idea Pane / Development To Do List 
- [ ] __Implement Depth perception using a camera__ <br/> 
    - [Method 1](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_calib3d/py_depthmap/py_depthmap.html#py-depthmap)<br/> 
    - [Method 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNft4RFsK28), the links for which can be found [here](http://visual.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pubs/monoDepth/) and [here](https://github.com/mrharicot/monodepth)<br/>
    - This [Blog](https://albertarmea.com/post/opencv-stereo-camera/)  presents a good example of depth from a stereo camera . <br/>
    - _Figure out if it can be somehow used in the final thing . Avoid ML in this stage_
- [ ] __Vanilla People Tracking : Just track people in a frame__ 
    - Use ML . Just find people in a frame 
        - [Haar Cascade Implementation](https://medium.com/@madhawavidanapathirana/https-medium-com-madhawavidanapathirana-real-time-human-detection-in-computer-vision-part-1-2acb851f4e55)
        - [HOG + Linear SVM Implementation](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/11/09/pedestrian-detection-opencv/)
- [ ] __Age , Gender Detector__ 
    - Find things about people in frame . Kinda far fetched due to low accuracy 
    - [This](https://www.vocal.com/video/face-detection-using-viola-jones-algorithm/) explains Viola Jones , alternatively [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEJ71VlUmMQ) video 
- [ ] __Make an interactive dashboard for the stuff__ 
    - Try something that runs offline like PyGame or PyPlot . 
- [ ] __Add correlation filters ([Kalman?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter)) to reduce re-entry errors__  
    - Purely to improve accuracy . Attempt in the end .
